# 🔁 Palindrome Number Checker

## 🧠 Challenge Overview  
In this challenge, the goal is to **check whether a given number is a palindrome** or not. A palindrome is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed — like `121`, `1331`, or `12321`.

## 🎯 What I'm Solving  
I’ll write a program that takes an input number and determines whether it's a palindrome. The logic should work for any positive integer and gracefully handle edge cases (like single-digit numbers or numbers with trailing zeros).

## ⚔️ The Real Challenge  
- **Understanding palindromes** beyond just words — here, it’s about numbers.  
- **Manipulating digits**: I need to reverse a number without converting it unnecessarily (if possible).  
- **Logical reasoning**: Ensuring the original number and the reversed version are compared accurately.  
- **Edge case handling**: What if the number is a single digit? Or ends with zero?
